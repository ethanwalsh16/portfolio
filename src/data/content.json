		{
			"point":"Currently studying software engineering at McMaster University. In the past, I've worked for a variety of companies and institutions as an intern, ranging from education to energy."

		{
			"point":"My main interests when it comes to software are making music education and production more accessible, the intersection of software with the nuclear industry, and applications of transit logistics. Outside of school, I am a huge fan of sports such as golf, hockey, and skiing, music (in particular jazz), and all things related to public transit."
